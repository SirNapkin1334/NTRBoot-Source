		<h1>Soprano: By SirNapkin1334</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Soprano is the voice part of a choir that sings the highest. It is typically sung by females, however occasionally some males are able to sing it. This is typically called falsetto. Soprano is defined as singing between 261 and 880 Hz.</p>
		<h4>Etymology</h4>
		<p>The word "Soprano" comes from the Italian word <i>sopra</i>, meaning "above," since it is the highest pitch of voice.</p>
		<p>Soprano in German is <i>Sopran<i>, and Italian & French both are simply "Soprano."</p>

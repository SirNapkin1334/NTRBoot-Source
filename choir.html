		<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p style="line-height: 0.7;">Soprano is the voice part of a choir that sings the highest. It is typically sung by females, however occasionally some males are able to sing it. This is typically called falsetto. Soprano is defined as singing between 261 and 880 Hz.</p>
		<h3>Etymology</h3>
			<p>The word "Soprano" comes from the Italian word <i>sopra,</i> meaning "above," since it is the highest pitch of voice. Soprano in German is <i>Sopran,</i> and Italian & French both are simply "Soprano."</p>

		<h3>Styles</h3>
			<p style="line-height: 1;">Besides Choral music, there are many different styles for Soprano singing. One you might not think of is Operatic Rock, signing rock music with a high, Opera-like pitch. Generally it is a collection of songs that relate to a common story or theme. Though rarely written to be acted out, occasionally some have been turned into rock musicals.</p>
		<h3>Well-known Choirs and Roles</h3>
			<p style="line-height: 0.5">A very well known Soprano role in an Opera is The Queen of the Night, from Mozart's <i>Die Zauberfl&oumlte.</i> It's known for having very high notes and many complicated and very difficult songs.</p>
			<p style="line-height: 0.5">A famous Choir is the Vienna Boys Choir which is a group of male Sopranos and Altos based in Austria.</p>
			<p>Tying into the role, one of the most famous Arias is <i>Der H&oumllle Rache</i> sung by the Queen of the Night. The song features <i>extremely</i> high notes and what is almost singing like a human flute.</p

		<h3>Jokes</h3>
			<p style="line-height: 0.2;">If you throw a Violist and a Soprano off of a Cliff, which one will hit the ground first?</p>
			<p style="line-height: 0.2;margin-left: 60px;">The Violist, since the Soprano will stop halfway down to ask for directions.</p>
			<p>What's the definition of an Alto?</p>
			<p style="line-height: 0.2;margin-left: 60px;">A Soprano who can sightread.</p>
			<p>Why did the Soprano get arrested?</p>
			<p style="line-height: 0.2;margin-left: 60px;">They were in treble.</p> <!-- this joke said "she was in trouble" but not all sopranos are female!! -->

<!-- to any person good at HTML reading this - I'm sorry for using style tags everywhere instead of div. I just don't have the time currently -->
<!-- I worked quite hard on this and had to do a lot of research to be able to write a lot of this HTML (to augment my memory) besides completely having to re-remember CSS. -->

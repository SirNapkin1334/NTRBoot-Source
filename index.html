    <p>Here you can find my <a href="https://sirnapkin1334.github.io/file/ntr.7z">ntrboot package</a> (an extended version of the homebrew starter pack, with some payloads as well), and also links to any other projects that I might be working on (none atm).</p>
    <a href="idols.html">Here's a list of people you should check out.</a>
    <br>
    <p><a href="coolness.html">Here are some of my favorite projects by other people.</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>And, here's a cat, since I love kitties.</p>
